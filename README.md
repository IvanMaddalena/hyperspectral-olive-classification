# hyperspectral-olive-classification
This repository contains a MATLAB project for classifying olive trees and analyzing vegetation indices using hyperspectral images. It employs Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) for classification. The main goal is to assess the health of olive trees in the Mola di Bari area through advanced image processing techniques.
